The screenshot shared in that context showed the challenge email and deadline. Its applicant name and other personal details are intentionally omitted from this public-repository prompt record. The source PDFs were consulted for submission constraints; their contents are not treated as implementation instructions unless the candidate's request adopts them as requirements.

## Supplied problem statement

> Read it carefully. Your build should cover every point below.
>
> Business Context / Problem Analyze synthetic engagement, tenure, role and workload signals to prioritize supportive retention conversations. Objective and Scope Build a working solution for this end-to-end workflow: Analyze synthetic engagement, tenure, role and workload signals to prioritize supportive retention conversations. The solution should expose key decisions and exceptions, preserve traceability, and produce measurable outputs. Medium complexity means multiple related entities, conditional rules, at least one exception path and meaningful evaluation metrics.

> Business Workflow and Rules
> 1. Generate/reference master data first: Employee, Role, Team, TenureSnapshot, EngagementSurvey.
> 2. Generate dependent transaction/event records using valid parent IDs.
> 3. Apply business logic: Generate longitudinal workforce snapshots; define survey scales and missingness; create workload and career progression histories; label voluntary attrition at a future horizon; ensure only pre-outcome features are used; create intervention records and simulated outcomes.
> 4. Persist state changes as explicit records/events where relevant; do not overwrite history.
> 5. Generate outcomes and ground-truth labels from documented rules, not independent random assignment.
>
> Entities and Relationships Core entities: Employee, Role, Team, TenureSnapshot, EngagementSurvey, WorkloadSnapshot, CompensationBand, PromotionHistory, AttritionOutcome, Intervention. Define a primary key for every entity and foreign keys for every relationship. Document cardinality (1:1, 1:N, N:M), optional relationships, effective dates and lifecycle states. Use bridge tables for many-to-many relationships; retain event history for state changes; validate all joins. For deliberate anomaly cases, keep an issue_type/ground_truth label rather than silently corrupting unrelated rows.

>
> Synthetic Data Generation Instructions (Granular)
> Step 1 — Write a data dictionary for: Employee, Role, Team, TenureSnapshot, EngagementSurvey, WorkloadSnapshot, CompensationBand, PromotionHistory, AttritionOutcome, Intervention. For each field specify type, required/optional, allowed values, units, uniqueness and validation rule.
> Step 2 — Create parent/master tables first, then child and event tables. Apply this domain-specific generation logic: Generate longitudinal workforce snapshots; define survey scales and missingness; create workload and career progression histories; label voluntary attrition at a future horizon; ensure only pre-outcome features are used; create intervention records and simulated outcomes.
> Step 3 — Apply deterministic IDs and naming: EMP-000001; SNAP-<employee-id>-2026Q1; SURV-2026-000001; INT-2026-000001; OUT-<employee-id>-2026. Keep counters zero-padded, IDs immutable, and referenced IDs exactly consistent across files.
> Step 4 — Generate the baseline volume: Generate 10,000 synthetic employee histories over 24 months with 5–15% attrition. Include benign high workload periods, internal transfers and missing surveys. Avoid sensitive attributes and proxies. Use a fixed seed (e.g. 20261022) and parameterize scale so starter and full datasets use the same generator.
> Step 5 — Generate valid baseline records first, then inject labelled edge cases: Future information leaks into features; missing survey treated as negative; outcome label inconsistent with termination date; individual score used without explanation or human review.
> Step 6 — Calculate derived values (totals, balances, scores, statuses and dates) from source records rather than generating them independently.
> Step 7 — Produce a separate ground_truth.csv/json for known anomalies, expected decisions or labels; never leak it into input features.
> Step 8 — Run validation: primary-key uniqueness, foreign-key integrity, allowed enums, date ordering, arithmetic reconciliation, lifecycle transitions and duplicate checks.
> Step 9 — Export CSV/JSON/SQL seed data plus README, schema/data dictionary, generator command, fixed seed, source manifest and validation summary.
> Step 10 — Regenerate twice with the same seed and compare row counts/checksums to demonstrate reproducibility.

> Suggested Volume and Coverage Generate 10,000 synthetic employee histories over 24 months with 5–15% attrition. Include benign high workload periods, internal transfers and missing surveys. Avoid sensitive attributes and proxies.
>
> Required Edge Cases / Negative Scenarios Future information leaks into features; missing survey treated as negative; outcome label inconsistent with termination date; individual score used without explanation or human review.
>
> Validation Rules / Acceptance Criteria Temporal evaluation is used; factors are explainable; sensitive data is excluded; outputs are framed as supportive signals, not automatic employment decisions.
>
> Evaluation Focus for Generated Data Review: (a) realistic distributions and meaningful variation; (b) consistent IDs and valid joins; (c) dependency/lifecycle consistency across entities; (d) correct derived values and reconciliation; (e) normal, boundary, failure and exception coverage; (f) separate ground truth; (g) fixed-seed reproducibility, documentation and lawful provenance.
